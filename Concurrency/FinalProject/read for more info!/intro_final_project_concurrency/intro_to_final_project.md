In my final project of concurrency, I make a CLI (Command-Line Interface) concurrent downloader to download multiple websites concurrently using command lines in the terminal.

In this downloader I coded all threading, asyncio, and multiprocessing models then benchmark them based on total time run and its successful downloads then rank them and analyze them.

Btw there are logs for threading and asyncio downloads, but unfortunately there is no log for multiprocessing approach because its not process safe.

For more visualization you can check the high level diagram next to this to understand the big picture. Also check my benchmark results and my analysis! üòÅ
